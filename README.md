# Reversi
Reversi AI implementation

The program initiates by prompting the user for board dimensions and determining the player colors. Assuming Black takes the first move, the board is printed after each play. Turns alternate between Black and White, with the program detecting no valid moves for White and prompting Black for another move. After each turn, the board is updated, and the program identifies wins or draws, displaying messages like "W player wins," "B player wins," or "Draw!" Upon an illegal move by the human player, an error message is shown, and the game ends, declaring the winner.
